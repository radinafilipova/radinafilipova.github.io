                    <h2>The Manul Cat Is The Most Expressive Cat In The World</h2>
                </header>

                <p>
                    Manul cats are a near-threatened wild species found in the grasslands and montane steppes of Central Asia. More commonly known as Pallas' cats, they are distinguished by having round pupils, short legs, and a flat-looking face with wide-set ears that can create some of the funniest expressions in the feline kingdom.<br/><br/>
                    The Pallas' cats high-elevation habitat of up to 5,000m (more than 16,000ft) results in a weakened immune system from lack of exposure to viral infections. For this reason, survival rates are low in captivity, and new litters see a mortality rate of up to 44.9%.<br/><br/>
                    Although these fun photos make the Pallas' cat seem like an interesting pet with an expressive face, their solitary and wild nature, as well as their high mortality rate at low altitudes, restricts them primarily to professional zoos.

                    <h2>Sand Cats: Where The Adults Are Kittens And The Kittens Are Also Kittens</h2>
                </header>

                <p>
                    Sand cats are the Peter Pan of felines: they retain a kitten-like appearance their whole lives, giving the impression that they never grow up. Although they live in the desert Areas of North Africa, Arabia, Central Asia, and Pakistan, they are considered near threatened due to the illegal pet trade and sport hunting.<br/><br/>
                    These cats are well adapted to their harsh environment. They can survive in temperatures between −5 °C (23 °F) to 52 °C (126 °F) and are able to survive for months on the water in their food. Unfortunately, a recent study indicated that only 61% of sand cats born in captivity live to day 30, primarily due to maternal neglect; they are also prone to various respiratory illnesses which makes them unsuitable as pets.
